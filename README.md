# geocausal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geocausal is to implement spatio-temporal causal inference
based on point process data. Users provide the raw data of locations and
timings of treatment and outcome events, specify counterfactual
scenarios, and the package estimates causal effects over specified
spatial and temporal windows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geocausal from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mmukaigawara/geocausal")
```
