# geocausal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geocausal is to implement spatio-temporal causal inference based on point process data. Users provide the raw data of locations and timings of treatment and outcome events, specify counterfactual scenarios, and the package estimates causal effects over specified spatial and temporal windows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geocausal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mmukaigawara/geocausal")
```
