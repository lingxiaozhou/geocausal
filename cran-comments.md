## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

## This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

* written information messages with message() and warning() rather than print() or cat()

* included small executable examples in the Rd-files. Since some functions use results from other functions, and running all other functions in one example becomes computationally demanding, I intentionally skipped examples for several functions.
